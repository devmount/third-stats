## Get started

Install ThirdStats from the Thunderbird Add-ons repository:

1. Start Thunderbird, open the main menu and click on Add-ons
2. Search for *ThirdStats*
3. Click *Add to Thunderbird* and give necessary permissions
4. Open the ThirdStats Popup in the upper right corner of the main toolbar and enjoy your email account stats

To properly recognize emails as *sent*, make sure to configure all email adresses you write from as Thunderbird identities for your email account. You can do so under *account settings* > select your account > click button *more identities* at the bottom and add or modify identities as you need.

Also keep in mind, that the processing of large mailboxes can take a lot of time.

## Features

- Check key numbers like total, received or sent emails per account
- Analyze the progress of email counts per year, per month, per daytime, per weekday, per folder and many more
- See your most busy hours during the week
- Find out, which contacts are the ones sending most emails
- Filter stats for a specific folder, date range or contact
- Compare different email accounts with each other and define their color
- Set Options for account selection, theme, caching system and a lot more customizations
- Enjoy the responsive stats page adapting to different viewport sizes
- Have language support for Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Ukrainian

Here is how ThirdStats looks like on the Thunderbird default dark theme and light theme on Windows:

## Privacy and Security

ThirdStats runs entirely locally and will never contact, send or sell data to, any third-parties.

ThirdStats features require [Thunderbird permissions](https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/mailextensions/supported-webextension-api) to function, but will always seeks to minimise permissions where possible, and use granular permissions where available (Example: Thunderbird Permissions API does not currently provide for reading only message headers, instead of the entire email, including the body):

- Accounts: Access accounts and identities (read-only)
- Downloads: Export and download data as a file
- Messages: Access messages to create statistics (read-only)
- Storage: Store processed data (cache) for performance. Can be cleared or disabled at any time.

See the [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md) for details how ThirdStats values your privacy.

If you encounter any problem, please [issue a bug report](https://github.com/devmount/third-stats/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). If you have ideas for additional features, please [issue a feature request](https://github.com/devmount/third-stats/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

### Become a ThirdStats developer

Here is how you can set up a local development environment:

1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) this project with Git
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` within the cloned directory `third-stats/`
3. Start the development server with `npm run serve`
4. Open development site by going to <http://localhost:8080> in your browser

Note that this tool uses [Thunderbirds WebExtension APIs](https://thunderbird-webextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). This means that some JavaScript objects won't be available in your browser as development environment. If you want to test your changes in Thunderbird, do the following:

5. Save all your changes and run `npm run build` to create a production build in the `dist/` directory
6. Open Thunderbird, go to main menu > add-ons > gear menu > debug add-ons > This Thunderbird > Load temporary add-on
7. Now choose the manifest file inside the `dist/` directory and your modified add-on will be loaded for the current Thunderbird session. You can check the web console by clicking the button *Inspect* in the add-on tile.
