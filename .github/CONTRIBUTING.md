## How to contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please make sure there isn't already an existing issue describing your problem, for bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/devmount/third-stats/issues). Simply create an issue and provide the necessary information by filling in [the bug-report template](https://github.com/devmount/third-stats/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are also tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/devmount/third-stats/issues). Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check the existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in [the feature-request template](https://github.com/devmount/third-stats/issues/new?template=feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

### Pull Requests

Simply fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Please do not include issue numbers in the PR title, but mention it in the PR body.

### Providing Translations

You can add a new translation or improve an existing one by taking the following steps:

1. Go to [Localazy](https://localazy.com)
2. Click *Sign in* (upper right)
3. Choose *Sign in with Github* (or another method you prefer)
4. Click *Authorize Localazy*
5. Open the [ThirdStats project](https://localazy.com/p/third-stats)
6. Choose a language and start translating. As this project is public, you don't need any authentification, just start to translate ThridStats. You'll be made a trusted translator later.

If you run into any problems, leave a comment on [the corresponding issue #343](https://github.com/devmount/third-stats/issues/343) or start [a discussion thread](https://github.com/devmount/third-stats/discussions).
